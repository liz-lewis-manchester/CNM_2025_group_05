# CNM_2025_group_05

this section is to go through all the individual test cases outlined in the coursework brief
1) in this test case, we are given a set of initial conditions and boundaries (dx = 20cm, initial concrentation = 250, u = 0.1m/s, x = 0->20m, time = 5 mins) and model the simulation with them
2) in this test case, we are going to use the coniditions given in the initial conditions CSV file and interpolate them
3) in this test case, we are going to test the model sensitivity to its given parameters
4) in this test case, we are going to see how an exponentially decreasing initial concentration affects the model
5) in this test case, we are going to see how perturbations in the velocity (+- 10%) affect the model
