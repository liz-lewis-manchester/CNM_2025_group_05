# Velocity
The base veocity is set as U.
Apply random velocity pertubations (variation of ±10%)
# Solver 
To predict how the pollution travels down a river over time using upwind numerical scheme. 
theta0: the starting pollution values
U: the river velocity
dx: spacing of the grid
dt: size of each time step
nt: number of time steps
